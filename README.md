Audiobook-Player
================

I couldn't find an iOS 7 app to play my audiobooks at 1.5x...so I am going to make one

Planning this out
-----------------

It's 3AM so I should probably write out the plan for this before going to sleep
I am going to use the ABPAudioManager as a singleton that does the audio look ups and plays the audio. This is going to be my model in the MVC paradig,
The view controllers right now are just simple ABPMaster/DetailViewControllers that will eventually have to be rewritten.
I want this to eventually have a nice design, but for now it will be stock controls. As I said I will eventually put some design thought into this. When I start doing that I will post screen shots in this readme
So yeah, goals are to load in audiobooks and get them playing at 1x first, then 1.5x. Then worry about a design.
